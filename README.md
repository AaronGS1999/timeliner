# Timeliner

Quickly make a pretty timeline by forking this repo and editing the config file.

**https://timeline.metamorphium.com**

## Why

When everyone was reflecting on the past decade at the start of 2020, I made a timeline of my past 3 decades. It was heavily inspired by [Harper Reed's site](https://harperreed.com).

Timelines are a fun way to visualize someone's life and get to know them quickly. You can see their life's trajectory and important highlights. This is not meant to be a resume. Instead, have fun with it - share quirky moments or fun anecdotes!

Or be boring and use it as a changelog for your software. What do I care?

## How

1. Fork this repo
2. Edit `_config.yml` to fill in your personal details and timeline events.
3. Go to your fork's settings tab, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section, select the `master` branch source and click Save.
4. Visit http://username.github.io/timeliner

This template creates a single static page generated by Jekyll with the events in `_config.yml`. That's it. To build the page yourself, clone this repo and run `jekyll build`
